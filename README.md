# excursion
## A portfolio project

 - The `excursion` project is a part of the @![Codecademy's](https://github.com/Codecademy) ![course](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-git) on Git.
The initial objective of the project was to produce a working copy of a web application based solely on a screenshot and a redline mock:

- While the purpose of the project was to practice basic Git skills, I've found it useful to demonstrate my #HTML and #CSS skills too.
My version of the web app looks a bit different than the screenshot provided by Codeacademy.
1. After replicating the original design, I decided to optimize its alignment and readability.
2. In the project, I use other media than those provided in the task. The purpose was to challenge myself by dealing with raw external objects instead of using pre-tailored media objects at hand.
